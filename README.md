# autorasch

These were initial files of an R package that eventually became [whomds](https://github.com/lindsayevanslee/whomds). The original vision was to write a package that could fully automate the Rasch Analysis process. That has not been achieved (yet), but whomds at least greatly simplifies the process for users.

This repository is now archived.
